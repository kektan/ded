# Ame's iOS 16 First Impressions

So apparently iOS 16 has [finally been released](https://youtu.be/yH0JgQ5i75o) (potential volume warning) and instead of spamming a chatroom, I thought maybe I should just make a blogpost here instead (not like no one visits this site anyway and maybe i should have written in a [rentry](https://rentry.co/) anyway.)
I probably won't go into much detail about the new features since it's only been day 2 as of this writing.

## [Lock Screen Customizations](https://youtu.be/yH0JgQ5i75o)

(again, volume warning for the above.)   
LOCK SCREEN CUSTOMIZATION, MY BELOVED :plsplspls:   

This might as well be one of the most defining features of the new iOS. Despite the concept existing since forever, you can now customize, albiet limited, your lock screen in iOS. That alone is a pretty big win, in my book.   

Such customization include:   
- Clock Font (about 8x3 different combinations) and colors
- 6 different lock screen types (Emoji looks the ugliest
- Filters for Photo-type lock screens
- Widgets!!! 
- ...and probably more that I glossed over.

Not too different from my old lock screen, but it's what makes me, "me".   
I think my pet peeve is that you can't edit your "first" lock screen, so you'd have to make a new one in order to customize, add widgets, etc. May my 2nd lock screen (pictured above) be my forever one.   

Worth noting that notifications will now appear on the bottom as "stacks". To return to the good ol' days where the future never happened, you can turn them back to a "list" in the Notifications tab in Settings.   

## Full Screen Music Player (in Lock Screen)

This is probably another one of my favorite features in iOS 16.   
Before, when playing music (or videos if you're a YouTube Premium pleb), a medium sized widget will appear. Kinda like this:

Now check this out:   !
![aaa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47435073/190043871-da31a2a3-77d8-40e6-9d7b-f2444c53d3f1.jpeg)

Yes, the music player gets bigger and the blurred background will match the album art along with it. It's not a really big deal to some people (perhaps there's some people clamoring to "turn it back"...) but it's a very aesthetic change that I kinda like. Plus, whatever you named your Bluetooth device won't be visible when you take a screenshot as it will appear as an icon on the bottom right, replacing the AirDrop icon.   
tl;dr: redesign is pog for aesthetic (personal opinion) reasons.   

## Subject Isolation in Photos
...or whatever official name Apple has with that.   
This is basically a built in [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) in the Photos app. May or may not be relevant to the people whose photos consist of stolen memes from Twitter.   
How this is done is by long pressing a "subject" (say, a singular sushi from a photo of a plate of that sushi) and then it will "glow". Options to copy or share will show up.

Amazing on what machine learning can do but it is not entirely perfect. It doesn't work particularly well on illustrations and artwork.   
Something cool, but not sure if it's something I'd use commonly (considering I am one of the people with entirely memes and screenshots in their phone.)   

Now we're done with what I have currently messed with until now, so I'll get on with my current pet peeves within the new update.

## Pet Peeves

- **Notifications**
Since before the new update, I always had notifications going on in my lock screen even when on Focus mode (two of my most used ones are for when I'm at school and when I'm asleep)   
Despite the red notification badge on my home screen, those notifications won't show up in my lock screen during one of those Focus modes, which makes it a little annoying. Drawbacks of a new update I guess, it's not really enough to make me want to go back to iOS 15.   
Perhaps I should spend a little more time in my Settings.

welp that's all of my impressions as of now. I have not encountered any real issues (then again, I updated using my Macbook instead of On The Air, which is updating directly on my phone) thus far. Perhaps I'm just lucky.   

so far it's **9/10**   
k bye
