# How to Talk to Your Oshi in Online Event (22/7 Edition)

So you want to meet your oshi (fave) in an online event they're holding. Maybe spiral into talk/cheki (polaroid)/sign (autograph)-kai hell as well.
You have come to the right place! Look no further to this shitty guide. 

In this guide, we will cover three things:

1. [Signing up on FortuneMusic](#signing-up-for-fortunemeets)
2. [Getting tickets](#getting-tickets)
3. Downloading and using the FortuneMeets app

**NOTE**: This guide will assume you have a _Tenso (proxy service) or a Japanese address_ you can use to have items shipped to you. If you don't, go apply for one first. 
Any specific questions on how to sign up can be answered at the #events chat at the [22/7 Discord](https://discord.gg/227) server.

ok let's get started :point_down: :sunglasses: :point_down:

2. Click the green button on the right (規約に同意して次に進む) when you go to the Terms and Conditions page.
3. Now for the actual sign up page. The following images has been autotranslated for the sake of this guide.
   1. For inputting your name in kanji, enter your name normally in latin letters.
![step3a](https://i.imgur.com/mCVaKn1.png)
   2. The name form below is the reading of your name in furigana so put your name in katakana. Use an [online keyboard](https://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/katakana.htm) if you have to. Or have someone transliterate it for you. **NOTE: family name (last name) goes first, given name goes last.**
   3. Put in your email. This will be your login id. Enter it again in the text form below
   4. Password. Then confirm password.
   5. This is where you need your Tenso address. But you'll only need to type in the postal code and click the green button. The only last three you'll only need to copy and paste from your Tenso address. (TL Note: denwa bangou means telephone number. use the number from your Tenso.)
![step3b](https://i.imgur.com/buIxbvp.png)
   6. Finish up by choosing your gender (Male or Female), inputting date of birth, and choosing if you want to get bombarded with spam. Click the green button on the bottom.
![step3c](https://i.imgur.com/6xUDoP7.png)
   7. You will need to go to your email to confirm registration. Go check your email and look for the registration confirmation email. Click on that link.
   8. Congrats you're finished. But not quite! You need to add your credit card info!
   9. When you get to the screen after clicking the link on your confirmation email, go to the first grey box.
   10. Type in your credit card details. Card number, expiration date, name on card and security code. Do the captcha too.
   11. ok *now* you're done

## Getting Tickets
so now you wanna talk to your oshi. maybe get an autograph from them

before we start i wanna clarify a few things. 

1. Talk-kai and Cheki/Sign-kai are **different events**. You won't get an autograph if you attend a Talk-kai event lmao.
2. There are different days/times when those go on.
3. The latter is more expensive. 

got it? got it.

1. Luckily, the FortuneMusic homepage should already feature 22/7 when you go there. Scroll down until you see a schedule of sorts.
2. You should see stuff when you scroll down. If you see a green button (受付中) then you can sign up there. 
3. On that next screen, you can see a list of members and the times and date they will be available. Most of you might be signing up to see Sally Amaki or something lol but for the people that don't understand a lick of Japanese (again, why are you here), here's a table of the member's names in kanji and a TL of it.
   1. If you live in a timezone that's vastly different than JST, google `[time] JST to [your own timezone]`. 

| Members | TL |
| --- | --- |
| 天城サリー | [Sally Amaki](https://nanabunnonijyuuni.fandom.com/wiki/Sally_Amaki)| 
| 海乃るり | [Ruri Umino](https://nanabunnonijyuuni.fandom.com/wiki/Ruri_Umino) |
| 河瀬詩 | [Uta Kawase](https://nanabunnonijyuuni.fandom.com/wiki/Uta_Kawase) |
| 倉岡水巴 | [Mizuha Kuraoka](https://nanabunnonijyuuni.fandom.com/wiki/Mizuha_Kuraoka) |
| 西條和 | [Nagomi Saijou](https://nanabunnonijyuuni.fandom.com/wiki/Nagomi_Saijo) |
| 白沢かなえ | [Kanae Shirosawa](https://nanabunnonijyuuni.fandom.com/wiki/Kanae_Shirosawa) |
| 涼花萌 | [Moe Suzuhana](https://nanabunnonijyuuni.fandom.com/wiki/Moe_Suzuhana) |

| ~~帆風千春~~ | ~~Chiharu Hokaze~~ (to be updated) |
| 宮瀬玲奈 | [Reina Miyase](https://nanabunnonijyuuni.fandom.com/wiki/Reina_Miyase) | 

4. Scroll down until you see green down arrows on grey blocks. You’ll see whichever slot that a member is available (refer to previous page for exact times.)  click on the dropdown boxes and choose an amount of tickets you want. If you’re done, scroll down and click green button (カートへ進む) 
5. So now you’re ready to pay. Click on the 6 boxes and click the right button on the bottom (unless you’re a elementary schooler)   
6. Next screen is the confirmation screen. Click the green button.   
7. You're done now lol

## Downloading and using the FortuneMeets app

1. You might want to get used to the app before the actual day of the online event. If you haven't download the [app](https://www.fortunemusic.app/).   
   NOTE: You might need to set your App/Play Store region to Japan to get the app. You'll only need to switch to a Japanese Apple ID on iOS (i'm not familiar with android so you might need to figure out how to install JPN apps yourself)   
2. When you open the app, you should see a bunch of events for 22/7. Press the second button on the bottom to log in (your login should be the same you signed up FortuneMusic with.)
3. After you log in, you should see the events you have already paid for. If today's the day of the event, wait for the queue to open.
4. Wait in the queue.
5. Congrats you have met your oshi. 

if you made it this far, it may be already too late. 

...and that's the end of the guide.
